Programming Exercise:

Use JQuery Mobile to create a voting app, each group can decide what type of voting app they want to implement (speed dating, pets, classes, etc.). Anything that requires a "yes" or "no" decision can do.
Requirements:
Preload 10 choices for voting as the web app starts up. Vote yes and no for 10 times.
The web app needs to present all the "yes" and "no" choices
Feel free to use localstorage or any php backend for application storage
