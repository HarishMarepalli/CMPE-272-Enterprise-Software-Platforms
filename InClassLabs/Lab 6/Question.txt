Lab
Form a group of TWO or THREE via https://chat.whatsapp.com/KdJ06VAcvOFGG55iQMWAf8, you pick your own group and software to meetup (5 min)
Work:

Given that you just learn encryption and decryption concepts,
Research and discuss whether person to person email such as gmail, outlook, yahoo mail, etc. are secure today or not. List your findings.
Also research and discuss whether a company can prevent internal email to leak into the public. Stay your stand and list your findings.

Email your writeups to coolprofsinn@gmail.com by the end of the 40 min research and discussion.
Remember to send list of members (one email per group), use group of 2 (or 3) max for this lab.
Return to class, and we will ask two groups to present to others.
