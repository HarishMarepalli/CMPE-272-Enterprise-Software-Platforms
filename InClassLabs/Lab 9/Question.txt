Lab
Form a group of TWO or THREE via https://chat.whatsapp.com/KdJ06VAcvOFGG55iQMWAf8, you pick your own group and software to meetup (5 min)
Work:

Your group would like to build a stock market prediction engine. Discuss in high level how you are going to build such prediction engine. Specifically, discuss what type of data and how is your group going to store such data in the prediction engine.
Hint:
How many stocks are you going to store?
What data do you store for each stock?
How long do you have to store each stock's data?
Are the data read only or read / write?
How can you build the prediction engine on top?
etc, etc, etc.

Email your writeups to coolprofsinn@gmail.com by the end of the 50 min research and discussion.
Remember to send list of members (one email per group), use group of 2 (or 3) max for this lab.
Return to class, and we will ask two groups to present to others. (Return to zoom @ 11:10 am)
